### IT’S TIME TO WAKE UP
Each year in the U.S., the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that 100,000 reported crashes result from driver fatigue, claiming some 1,500 lives and causing 71,000 injuries.
Statistics also show truck crashes kill more than 5,000 and injure 150,000 annually, with 750 of those fatalities and 20,000 injuries the result of a fatigued commercial vehicle driver, according to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.
Awake yet?


### CONCEPT + DEVELOPMENT
CogSpeed has been in the developmental stages since the 1980’s when Layne Perelli completed his dissertation research on the effects of fatigue and received a patent on it in 1982.
It is the mission of Gray Matter Metrics to open up a revolutionary approach to monitoring human performance anywhere, anytime and to make that valuable information available immediately to anyone who needs to know it. Our goal is to distribute products that improve work place safety, help save lives, and contribute to the overall health and well-being of society.
The technology was simply not in place for such a sophisticated web app capability until very recently. This application requires a lightweight portable device with very powerful, high-speed processing power connected to the internet for worldwide data collection. Only the latest advances in software engineering (Java Script, HTML5, .NET and SQL technologies), wide-spread internet and cellular connectivity, and the advanced microprocessors found in today’s mobile devices allow the app to run efficiently at an affordable price.
